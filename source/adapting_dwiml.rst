Creating your own project based on DWI_ML
=========================================

1. Create your own repository for your project.

2. Copy our scripts from ``please_copy_and_adapt``. Adapt them based on your needs. Instructions are in each file. Generally, you will need to implement child classes of the abstract classes we have prepared in dwi_ml.
