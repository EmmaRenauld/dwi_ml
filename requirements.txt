# Supported for python 3.10
# Should work for python > 3.8.

# -------
# Main dependency: scilpy
#    Scilpy and comet_ml both require requests. In comet: >=2.18.*,
#    which installs a version >2.28. Adding request version explicitely.
#
#    Changed many times the scilpy version. Tried to have latest fixed version,
#    but currently, working on beluga only when installing manually. But using
#    the master is not good; changes too fast for us. Using a fixed commit for
#    now.
