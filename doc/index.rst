Welcome to the `Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab (SCIL)`_ and
`Videos & Images Theory and Analytics Laboratory (VITAL)`_ joint DWI_ML
toolkit !

About
=====

DWI_ML is a toolkit for Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) analysis
using machine learning and deep learning methods. It is mostly focused on the
tractography derivatives of dMRI.

**Here is the usual workflow for people using dwi_ml**:

    #. Preprocess your diffusion data using Tractoflow (see :ref:`ref_preprocessing`).
    #. Preprocess your tractogram using RecobundlesX (see :ref:`ref_preprocessing`).
    #. Create a new repository for your project. Create a 'scripts_bash' folder and copy our scripts from please_copy_and_adapt. Adapt based on your needs and run:

        #. Run organize_from_tractoflow.sh
        #. Run organize_from_recobundles.sh
        #. Run create_dataset.sh
        #. Run training.sh
        #. Run tracking.sh
