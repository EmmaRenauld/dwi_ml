# dwi_ml

Welcome to the **scil-vital** dwi_ml git repo.



#### Common dependencies

We strongly recommand working in an environment (ex, VirtualEnv).

You will need the **VITALabAi** git repo installed. You can find it here: https://bitbucket.org/vitalab/vitalabai_public/

You will also need the **scilpy** git repo, which you can find here: https://github.com/scilus/scilpy

If you follow the installation instructions for these two repos, most requirements should be fullfilled. Other requirements are in requirements.txt

```bash
pip install -r pip-requirements.txt
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scil-vital/dwi_ml.git
