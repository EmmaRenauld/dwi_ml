# radius_vox = convert_mm2vox(radius_mm, affine_mm_to_vox)
def get_interp_neighborhood_vectors(radius_vox, method: str = "6axes") \
        -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns a neighbourhood based on the method choice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    radius_vox : float or list of floats.
        Distance to neighbors (in voxel space. Ex: 2 neighbours distance).
        See the "6axes" method for the list of floats usage. With the "grid"
        method, only a single float is accepted.
    method: str
        Choice of neigbhoorhood definition. Choices:
        "6axes": Returns a list of 6+1 positions. Up, down, left, right, behind,
                 in front at exactly `radius` length (+ 0,0,0).
                 If radius is a list of floats, returns a multi-radius
                 neighborhood, with 6 positions per radius (+ 0,0,0).
                 Good for RNN, for example.
        "grid":  Returns a 3D volume similar to the original voxel grid,
                 around (0,0,0,). Dimension 2*radius x 2*radius x 2*radius.
                 Good for CNN, for example.

    Returns
    -------
    directions : np.ndarray with last dimension = 3 (x,y,z coordinate for each
                 neighbour).
                 Coordinates are in voxel-space around the (0,0,0) coordinate.
                 You will need to interpolate the dwi in each direction around
                 your point of interest to get your neighbourhood.
